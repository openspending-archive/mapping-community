Throughout the research phase for this report, we have been continually surprised by the creativity with which citizens and communities have approached financial transparency. We set out to discover how civil society organisations were using government spending data, but we also discovered interesting cases of citizen and community uptake of spending dataâ€”evidence that the goal of driving citizen engagement with public spending by opening data is succeeding.

In this section, we highlight two cases of community-driven projects around spending data: the [OpenSpending](./openspending/) project, a community-run global database of spending data that has been enthusiastically used as a repository for *local* spending data, and an app to open up the [University of Granada's budget](./opening-university) built by a department within the university. These two projects provide an important reminder that grassroots local demand constitutes a significant source of pressure for increased spending transparency.
