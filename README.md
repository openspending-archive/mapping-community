Mapping the Open Spending Data Community
=================

This repo is the master manuscript of "[Mapping the Open Spending Data Community](http://community.openspending.org/research/mappingcommunity)" (the OSI report).

Two versions of the report, essentially identical, are hosted side-by-side here:

* the web branch, under `/web`
* the [easybook](easybook-project.org) manuscript, under `/easybook`

This repo also contains a Python script that can be used to re-publish the web version on the [OpenSpending Community Site](http://community.openspending.org), located (with its own README) in `/scripts`.
