<p>There are a set of staple tools that can be used to tackle many of the issues highlighted by the organisations in this report. For each one, we’ve outlined what the tool is useful for and what the barrier to entry is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic: An off-the-shelf tool that can be learned and first independent usage made of within one day. No installation on servers etc required.</li>
<li>Intermediate: Between one day and one week to master basic functionality. May require tweaking of code but not new creation thereof.</li>
<li>Advanced: Requires code.</li>
</ul>

<p>We continue to hunt for more and better tools to do the job and hope that some of the problems, such as governments publishing their data in PDFs or HTML, will soon be irrelevant so that we can all focus on more important things.</p>

<p><em>If you would like to suggest a tool to be added to this ecosystem, please email us at info [at] openspending.org</em></p>

<p><strong>Note on SPSS and R:</strong> It’s our impression that interviewees seemed largely to have been trained to use SPSS. R is however important to mention as it offers a free access to a broad section of the same models, though based on a programming interface.</p>

<p>A few examples of analysis on spending data, which can be done with statistical software such as SPSS or R:</p>

<p>
<strong>a)</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model">Hidden Markov</a>: Hidden Markov was originally developed for finding patterns in bioinformatics, but has turned out useful for predicting fraudulent and corrupt behaviour. Using Hidden Markov requires high quality data, and was for instance used to analyse spending data from 50 mio transactions in the Slovenian platform Supervizor. </p>

<p>
<strong>b)</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law">Benford's law</a>: Benford's law examines the distribution of figures in your data, against how it should actually look. Diversions from the normal distribution can help detect fraudulent reporting (eg. if companies tend to report ernings less than $500 mio. in order to fit a particular regulation Benford’s law could be a tool to detect that). Check this example using Benford’s law to test the release of all <a href="http://friism.com/tax-records-for-danish-companies">Danish corporate tax filings</a> and check this <a href="http://friism.com/tax-records-for-danish-companies">R blog post on the topic</a>. </p>

<p>Finally a few notes on the differences between SPSS and R: Though SPSS is fairly easy to get started using, it can be difficult to collaborate around as it applies its own SPSS data format. Some models might also be unavailable from the basic SPSS package. R is the free alternative, uses a programme interface, where all extensions are accessible, and where community support and code samples are widely available. One possible compromise bridging the convenience of SPSS and the wide usability of R, is the proprietary software <a href="http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/">R Revolution</a>.</p>

<p>See also the resources section in the <a href="http://openspending.org/resources/handbook/ch014_resources.html">Spending Data Handbook</a></p>

<p>Note: Many of these tools will have difficulty working on Internet Explorer (especially older versions), but we have yet to find more powerful tools which also work there.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-network-analysis">C.5 A note on Network Analysis</h2>

<p>As you will see from the case studies in the videos, Network Analysis is an area that more and more people are looking into with regard to public procurement and contracts.</p>

<p>Network visualisations are commonly used as a solution to this problem, however, we offer a note of caution to use them sparingly; due to the amount of data on which they are often used, they can sometimes be overwhelming and the average non-expert can find them hard to interpret.</p>

<p>Often the types of information that it is possible to extract from a network visualisation e.g. “who is best connected?”, “are there links between person X and person Y?” -  could be more easily be found with a searchable database of connections.</p>

<p>It may also be wise to separate tools suitable for investigating the data, and tools used to present the data. In the latter case, clarity and not-overloading the visualisation will most likely yield a clearer result, so this is one area in which custom infographics may win out in terms of delivering value.</p>

<h3 id="existing-solutions-for-network-mapping">C.5.1 Existing solutions for network mapping:</h3>

<p>For producing network visualisations there are currently open source solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a> (Again note that Gephi has non-visualisation functions to explore the data, which at times may be more useful in exploring the interconnections than the visualisations themselves).</li>
<li><a href="http://mapa76.com/">Mapa 76</a> - This is also interesting due to the function which is being developed to extract individual entities. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.visualdataweb.org/relfinder.php">RelFinder</a> Based off DBPedia, this tool structures and maps out relations between entities based on which articles they feature in on Wikipedia. </li>
<li>Google Fusion Tables has a network function </li>
<li>NodeXL is a powerful network toolkit for Excel. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-favourite-examples-of-non-network-ways-of-presenting-hierarchies-relationships-and-complex-systems">C.6 Some favourite examples of (non) Network ways of presenting hierarchies, relationships and complex systems:</h2>

<ul>

Additionally, it gives a detailed organisational diagram of the Communist Party of China, as well as timelines of people’s rise to power. </li>

<h1 id="obvious-tools-gaps">Appendix C Obvious tools gaps</h1>

<ul><li>A pipeline for local councils to address privacy concerns about publishing transaction-level data. In the UK, despite clear guidelines about what should be removed from data before publication, a few councils have published sensitive data over the past year. Some companies are looking at maintaining suppression lists for this data, however ideally this should be done in government, prior to publication, so workflows need to be developed for this. </li>
<li>Tools to help spot absence of publication as it happens. Currently, civil-society led initiatives such as the Open Budget Survey can only monitor publication of key budget documents retrospectively, and using large amounts of people power. There are a couple of possibilities which spring to mind:</li>
    <ul> 
<li>In the UK,  the OpenSpending team have been working with the team of data.gov.uk to <a href="http://community.openspending.org/2012/09/uk-departmental-government-spending-improving-the-quality-of-reporting/">produce automated reports</a> to help those enforcing transparency obligations to see which departments are not compliant with said regulations. The reports check both timeliness as well as structure and format of the data. This proved very successful at prompting data release initially - departments were given advance warning that the tool would be featured and any departments without up to date data would be flagged up in red; by launch date, nearly all departments had updated data. This is possible where:</li>
<ul>
<li>The data are published via a central platform (e.g. data.gov.uk)</li>
<li>The data are machine readable, so a computer program can quickly ascertain whether the required fields are present.</li>
<li>There is a standard layout for the data, so a computer can quickly verify whether column headings are correct and all present.</li>
</ul>

<li>Introducing a calendar of expected dates of publication of a particular dataset so that organisations could know when a document is expected to be published and enforce that it is. This could be done either on a country by country basis, or simply by aligning with internationally recognised, best practice guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<li>Tools which help to remove duplication of effort. For example, if one organisation has already cleaned up or extracted data from a PDF, encouraging them to share that data so another organisation does not have to waste time doing the same. </li>
</ul>
